hey guys, i know we're all pretty shaken up about andrew tate being arrested. i jst wnated to get out my thoughts on the subject.
personally, mr. tate helped me break out of the matrix! i make a lot of money (over a dozen dollars per day!) after joining hustler's university,
and i've never been happier. tatey did nothing wrong. every morning, i climb out mom's window and i scream my lamentations. "free andrew tate!" i say, but it
falls upon deaf ears. anyway guys, i'll write more tomorrow. it's bedtime ğŸ˜˜ğŸ˜˜ğŸ˜˜ğŸ˜˜ğŸ˜˜
